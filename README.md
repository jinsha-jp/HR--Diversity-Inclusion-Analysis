## Insights and Recommendation

1.	Gender Distribution: One key finding from the data is that male employees outnumber female employees by 18%.This distribution suggests a gender imbalance within the workforce. An in-depth analysis of gender distribution across departments reveals a concerning trend. The data indicates that while the Operations department has a relatively balanced gender distribution, all other departments show a higher percentage of male employees compared to females, suggesting a possible gender imbalance and a need for intervention.
2.	Gender Hiring Trends: While the company is generally working towards closing the gender gap, in the Sales & Marketing department, the percentage of male hires is 61%, compared to female hires at 39%. Similarly, the Strategy department exhibits a higher male hiring percentage of 60%, while female hires make up 40%
3.	Gender Disparity in Employee Promotions: Despite similar performance ratings for male and female employees, the promotion rates for male employees are considerably higher.
a.	In the Operations department, where the gender distribution is nearly equal (approximately 50% male and 50% female), 75% of promoted employees were male, despite no significant difference in performance ratings between genders.
b.	This disparity in promotions, despite similar performance ratings, suggests a systemic gender bias in decision-making processes. Such bias could lead to a lack of opportunities for female employees, which in turn could negatively impact employee morale, retention, and overall diversity within leadership roles
4.	Performance ratings for male and female employees are almost identical, with an average rating of 2.41 for males and 2.42 for females, showing no significant difference in performance.
5.	While overall gender diversity in the organization is improving, the senior leadership ranks remain predominantly male, which signals a disparity in how leadership roles are distributed.
6.	A large proportion of women employees are in junior positions. In junior positions, 53% of the employees are women, compared to 47% of men.
7.	The majority of employees who left the company came from the Operations and Sales & Marketing departments. With 58% of total leavers coming from Operations and 23% from Sales & Marketing.:
8.	Nearly half of the employees who left the company in FY20 were in this age range 20-29. The high turnover rate in this age group suggests that the company may face challenges in retaining young talent, potentially leading to a loss of fresh ideas and innovation.


## Recommendation:

1.	It's important to consider strategies for promoting gender diversity and inclusion in future hiring practices
   - Consider implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives aimed at attracting more female candidates.
   - Regularly review gender distribution data to track progress in achieving a more balanced workforce.
   - Implement bias training for managers and decision-makers to ensure that unconscious bias does not influence promotion decisions. Consider implementing a diversity and inclusion audit for promotion decisions to identify any gender-based disparities
2.	Conduct exit interviews: To better understand the reasons for turnover, implement structured exit interviews to gather insights directly from departing employees in these departments.
3.	Offer career progression programs: Create clear career development pathways to provide employees in Operations and Sales & Marketing with opportunities to advance within the company.
4.	Improve work-life balance initiatives: Ensure that employees in these high-turnover departments have access to flexible work arrangements or wellness programs to prevent burnout.
5.	Enhance career development programs: Provide clear career progression paths, mentorship, and development opportunities to help younger employees see a future with the company.
6.	Offer flexible work arrangements: Implement flexible working hours or remote work options to appeal to the younger workforce’s desire for a better work-life balance.
7.	Conduct employee feedback surveys: Regularly gather feedback from younger employees to understand their needs, expectations, and reasons for leaving, and use this data to improve retention strategies.
8.	Improve compensation and benefits: Ensure that compensation packages are competitive and attractive, particularly for younger employees who are at the start of their careers and may seek higher-paying opportunities elsewhere.
9.	Foster an inclusive, engaging company culture: Create a company culture that resonates with younger employees by emphasizing social responsibility, inclusivity, and innovation.

## Conclusion:
The project provides valuable insights for HR managers, proposed recommendations to make data-driven decisions and take proactive steps towards creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace culture.
Addressing gender imbalance will require focused efforts in recruitment, retention, and organizational culture to foster a more diverse and inclusive workplace.
Moving forward, it would be beneficial to analyse recruitment strategies and diversity initiatives to ensure a more balanced workforce
